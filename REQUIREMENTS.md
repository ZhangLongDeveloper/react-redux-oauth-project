Create an app that manages the inventory in a deposit.

The app will have a **layer of authentication** built with Google Sign-in 
(https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in). 

After sign-in, the user will be displayed the **app landing page**, a 
table with all the items in the inventory with filtering capabilities. 
Clicking on a row in the table will take the user to the **view of an item**. 
The view will display the **description of the item** and have actions available 
depending on the state of the item.

An item in the inventory is described by: **ID**, **Resource Name**, 
**Comment**, **Received Timestamp**, **Dispatched Timestamp** and **State** 
(**Received** or **Dispatched**). 

The lifecycle of an item in the inventory is described by the following actions:
- **Receive Item**: 
    - creates a new item in inventory;
    - ID needs to be autogenerated and be unique in the app;
    - Resource Name required field (text input)
    - Comment optional field (textarea input)
    - Received Timestamp is set on action submission
    - Set State to Received
- **Edit Item**:
    - Only available if item is in Received state
    - Edit Resource Name required field
    - Edit Comment optional field
- **Dispatch Item**:
    - Only available if item is in Received state
    - Set the item Dispatch Timestamp on action submissions
    - Set State to Dispatched

Requirements:
- Build the described flow;
- Use React and start from create-react-app;
- Manage app state using Redux;
- Validate user inputs in actions and display warning/error messages in accordance;
- Use a UI components library (Semantic-UI, Bootstrap, etc) and update with custom 
branding colors (primary #085276 and secondary #0CAA94);
- Google Account Sign-in;
- Export items from inventory in a .csv format;
- Save/Retrieve inventory data in/from browserâ€™s localstorage;
- Include a README describing the solution, how to start the development of the app 
and how to build it.

Bonus:
- Display a user profile page with info pulled from google.
- Create a small set of nodejs endpoints where data would be saved and retrieved 
from a database (opposed to localstorage).
